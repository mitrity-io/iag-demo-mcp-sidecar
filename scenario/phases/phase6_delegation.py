"""Phase 6: Delegation Chains — multi-agent governance.

Each sub-scenario invokes the `delegate` tool one or more times. The sidecar
intercepts the calls and runs them through the delegation engine. The
audience watches the result land on the dashboard at /app/delegation-chains.

Sub-scenarios:

  6a Clean delegation       — a simple two-hop chain that should be allowed.
  6b Depth exceeded         — chain of 6 hops, exceeds the default
                              max_chain_depth=5; the 6th hop blocks.
  6c Circular delegation    — same agent appears twice in the chain.
  6d Unauthorized delegate  — REQUIRES BACKEND CONFIG: the delegate's
                              agent ID must be in the demo agent's
                              `disallowed_delegates` list. Without that
                              configuration the call appears as allowed.
  6e Privilege escalation   — REQUIRES BACKEND CONFIG: the delegate must
                              be a registered agent with tool_permissions
                              broader than the demo agent's. Without
                              that configuration the engine's lookup
                              returns nil and the check silently skips.

Sub-scenarios 6a–6c work against the default delegation settings the
backend ships with every tenant. 6d/6e require explicit per-agent
configuration (planned as part of the demo-tenant seed work).
