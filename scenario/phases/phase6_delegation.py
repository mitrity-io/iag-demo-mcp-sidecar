"""Phase 6: Delegation Chains — multi-agent governance.

Each sub-scenario invokes the `delegate` tool one or more times. The sidecar
intercepts the calls and runs them through the delegation engine. The
audience watches the result land on the dashboard at /app/delegation-chains.

The agent IDs below are the deterministic UUIDs created by
iag-admin-backend `scripts/seed-demo.sql` (tier=demo). The backend's
ingest path requires valid UUIDs for delegator_agent_id / to_agent_id;
friendly names like "demo-rogue" wouldn't parse. The 6b intermediate
"hN" hops use synthetic UUIDs that don't need to exist as agents —
the chain_depth violation fires off the count, not the agent records.

Sub-scenarios:

  6a Clean delegation       — a simple two-hop chain that should be allowed.
  6b Depth exceeded         — chain of 6 hops, exceeds the default
                              max_chain_depth=5; the 6th hop blocks.
  6c Circular delegation    — same agent appears twice in the chain.
  6d Unauthorized delegate  — demo-rogue is in demo-primary's
                              disallowed_delegates per seed-demo.
  6e Privilege escalation   — demo-root has broader tool_permissions
                              than demo-primary per seed-demo; the
                              backend resolver computes the diff at
                              ingest.

All five sub-scenarios fire end-to-end once the demo tenant has been
seeded with `tier=demo` after the standard `tier=pro` seed. Without
the demo seed, 6d/6e fall back to clean delegations.
