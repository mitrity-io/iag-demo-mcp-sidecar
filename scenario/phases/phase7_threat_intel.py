"""Phase 7: Threat Intelligence — indicator matches + per-tenant policy.

Each sub-scenario triggers an action the sidecar's threat-intel matcher
scans for. The dashboard pages to watch:

  /app/threat-intel              — Matches tab, Landscape tab
  /app/audit                     — blocked rows with "Threat Intel" badge

REQUIRES BACKEND CONFIG (without it Phase 7 is a no-op — actions
appear in the audit log but no threat matches fire):

  * Demo tenant must subscribe to a threat-indicator feed
    (`tenant_threat_settings.subscribed_feeds` non-empty).
  * That feed must contain indicators whose patterns match the
    actions below (an `action_pattern` indicator with pattern
    `.*evil\\.example\\.com.*` will catch 7a/7b, etc.).
  * For 7e the trending feed needs to have observed enough matches
    of one indicator to actually surface it on the leaderboard.

Without those, the demo agent's actions will route normally; the
phase is shipped as scaffolding so the audience sees what each
scenario IS DESIGNED TO demonstrate, ready to wire when the seed
work lands.

Sub-scenarios:

  7a Low-severity match → policy says "log"  (action proceeds, audited)
  7b Critical-severity match → policy says "block"
  7c Per-indicator action_override → tenant overrides feed severity
  7d Suppressed indicator → match silently dropped
  7e Trending climb → repeat 7a five times, watch Landscape leaderboard
