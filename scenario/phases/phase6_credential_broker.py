"""Phase 6: Credential Broker + Hot Rotation.

Demonstrates the MITRITY sidecar substituting ${credential:<id>}
placeholders in outbound tool args using broker-resolved values. The
agent never sees the real credential — the sidecar resolves it
between governance approval and forwarding to the upstream MCP tool.

What this phase shows:

  6a Substitution works — the agent calls connect_database with a
     literal `${credential:demo_db_password}` in the connection string;
     the sidecar resolves it via the broker; the upstream tool sees the
     real password and returns its hash (which proves it received a
     real value, not the placeholder).

  6b Hot rotation — between two calls we ask the operator to rotate the
     credential in the MITRITY dashboard. The sidecar picks up the new
     value on the next heartbeat (≤30s) without restarting the agent
     or the sidecar. The second call's password hash differs from the
     first, proving the rotation propagated.

  6c Fail-closed semantics — the agent attempts to call
     connect_database with a non-existent credential ID. The sidecar
     responds with `credential.unresolvable` and the upstream tool
     never receives the call.

REQUIRES backend config (see README):

  - A credential definition named "demo_db_password" in the tenant.
  - A grant for that credential to the demo agent with "read" operation.
  - credentials.injection_enabled: true in sidecar.yaml (set by
    docker-compose.yml in this repo).

Without those, 6a/6b run as `credential.unresolvable` failures —
useful for testing the fail-closed path but not the substitution
itself.
